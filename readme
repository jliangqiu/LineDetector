I have implemented an adapation of the RANSAC algorithm as following:

    * apply gaussian blur and canny for edge detection (from opencv)
    * take nr_samples (1000 is good for basic lines) pairs of 2 points and for each pair:
        * find line equation
        * decide the line is a inliar or outliar by couting the nr of points near the line
            (param: if distance(point, line) < threshold_distance=1.9 -> point is on the line)
            (param: threshold_points near the line -> the line is an inliar)
        * split the line in many segments (param: max_diruption=4 between segments)
        * check if the segments is already taken (by the 2 starting points)
